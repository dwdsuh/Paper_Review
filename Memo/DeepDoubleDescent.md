# Deep Double Descent: where bigger models and more data hurt

[paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.02292.pdf)



+ double-descent: as we increase model size, performance first gets worse and then gets better
+ not only model size does trigger ddd, the number of training epochs also trigger ddd.

## Takeaways

+ EMC: effective model complexity
+ conjecture a generalized double descent wrt EMC
+
